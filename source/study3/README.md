Here, we provide source code for the bias mitigation method, ProxyMute, introduced in the following paper: [Sogancioglu, Gizem, Heysem Kaya, and Albert Ali Salah. "Using Explainability for Bias Mitigation: A Case Study for Fair Recruitment Assessment." Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction. 2023.]

In this repo, we evaluate ProxyMute and ProxyROAR methods for depression phenotype recognition task on MIMIC-III dataset.
I provide the details of these experiments in Chapter 6 of my Phd thesis: Towards Responsible Machine Learning in Mental Health, Gizem Sogancioglu.
